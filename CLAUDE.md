# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project repository (myfav-coworker) that is currently in initial setup phase.

## Development Setup

As this is a new repository with no existing code structure, consider the following when implementing features:

1. **Python Environment**: Use virtual environments (venv or similar) for dependency isolation
2. **Project Structure**: Follow standard Python project layout conventions when adding code
3. **Testing**: Consider pytest as the testing framework when tests are needed
4. **Linting**: Consider using ruff or black for code formatting when Python code is added

## Notes

- The repository uses a comprehensive Python .gitignore file
- No existing code structure or dependencies are present yet
